Vector by scalar multiplication is a fundamental operation in linear algebra and plays a crucial role in various mathematical and scientific disciplines. It involves scaling a vector by a scalar quantity, resulting in a new vector with adjusted magnitude but the same direction (if the scalar is positive) or opposite direction (if the scalar is negative). This operation is essential for understanding transformations, scaling, and stretching in vector spaces.
